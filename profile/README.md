## Overview

**T.A.I.L.S.** (Tactical Aerial Insight and Localization Suite) is a drone-based **Point-of-Interest (POI)** mapping solution designed to enhance search and rescue operations, wildlife monitoring, and coastal surveillance.  

The system integrates **AI-powered image recognition** with **GPS tracking** to detect and mark important locations on an interactive map within a mobile application. This project involves expertise in **artificial intelligence**, **real-time embedded programming**, **wireless communication**, and **network security**.

## Features
- üß† **AI Object Detection & POI Recognition**: Detect and classify objects of interest and transmit them as Points of Interest (POIs).  
- üõ∞Ô∏è **Long Distance Telemetry Transmission**: Real-time, long-range communication of drone position and altitude.  
- üì± **Mobile App Integration**: View past flight results, positions of recorded data points, and historical POIs directly in the app.

## Components

### On Board Node
The onboard module features a **Raspberry Pi 5**, **battery pack**, **LoRa-GPS module**, and a **Hailo AI hat** for accelerated inference. It uses a **Raspberry Pi Camera HQ** with a wide-angle lens to capture images, reads **GPS signals** from sensors, and creates **LoRa packets** for transmission.

### Base Station
The base station utilizes a **Heltec LoRa board** supporting both **BLE** and **LoRa** communication. It receives **LoRa packets** from the drone and converts them into **BLE packets** to send to connected devices.

### App
The mobile application is built with **React Native** using **Expo Go** and **Firebase** for backend services. It displays **Points of Interest (POIs)** on a map, along with **flight data**, and is accessible on both **mobile devices** and the **web**.
